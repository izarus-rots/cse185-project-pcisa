# cse185 project PCisA
---
PCisA is a na√Øve Python implementation of principal component analysis (PCA) in the place of `scanpy` PCA, meant to be used in conjunction with `anndata`.

# Installation
---
Installation requires several packages (`anndata`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and `scipy`). You can install these with:

```
pip install anndata
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install scipy
```

With a terminal in the same directory as PCisA, to install run:

```
python setup.py install
```

If the install worked, typing `pcisa -h` should show the help menu and basic usage instructions.

# Usage
---
PCisA's basic usage:

```
pcisa --data DATA --n_pcs N
```

where `--data` expects the path to a high-dimensional matrix and `--n_pcs` expects a number greater than zero.

To run PCisA on the test example provided in this repository, you can run

```
pcisa --data example-files/poisson.h5ad --n_pcs 2
```

## All Options
---
Required inputs are a matrix-like file and a value `n_pcs`. Other options can change how the calculation is performed:
