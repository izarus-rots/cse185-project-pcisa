# cse185 project PCisA

PCisA is a na√Øve Python implementation of principal component analysis (PCA) in the place of `scanpy` PCA, meant to be used in conjunction with `anndata`.

# Installation

Installation requires several packages (`anndata`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and `scipy`). You can install these with:

```
pip install anndata
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install scipy
```

To install, clone the repo, navigate to the directory, and install with the setup.py script:

```
git clone https://github.com/izarus-rots/cse185-project-pcisa
cd cse185-project-pcisa
python setup.py install
```

If the install worked, typing `pcisa -h` should show the help menu with basic usage instructions.

# Usage

PCisA's basic usage:

```
pcisa -f DATA -n N
```

where `-f` expects the path to a high-dimensional matrix and `-n` expects a number greater than zero.

To run PCisA on the test example provided in this repository, you can run

```
pcisa -f example-files/poisson.h5ad -n 2
```

## All Options

Required inputs are a matrix-like file and a value `n_pcs`. Other options can change how the calculation is performed or how the output will be given:
- `--output <filename>` or `-o <filename>`

    Allows you to specify a filename for the output. By default, outputs as `'pca_results.csv'`.

- `--outputdir <directory>` or `-d <directory>`

    Allows you to specify a location for the output. By default, outputs to the current directory `.`.
- `--plot` or `-p`

    Generates a quick plot for the PC results (only uses top two PCs). Default: `False`.
